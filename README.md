# Stock-Exchange-Market-Simulator
This is a finance based project programmed purely in Python.

Created as an assignment in JPMC Quant Finance Mentorship Program, this simulator gives the user a real time feel of
* how a stock market functions,
* how bids and asks are placed and matched in the stock market,
* what are the parameters which influence their pricing,
* how the Order Management System functions in the real exchanges,
* and how bids and asks pile up in orderly fashion and are later matched.

The entire program was implemented in Python using a variety of classes to represent the components of a trading system:

* Share,
* Stock exchange (with subclass Order Matching Engine),
* Trader (with subclass Order Management System)
